***********Auction***********
This is done on the command line interface hence no GUI
1) This take in user name and money.
2) Then ask if there is any other bidder.
3) If there are still bidder it does process '1' and '2' simultaneously.
4) Else it sgive the name and amount of the highest bidder.

Where auction is carried out, errors can me avoided since this program gives the highest bidder.
